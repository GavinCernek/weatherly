            <h1>How to Use</h1>
            <p>Enter a location into the search bar to get its current forecast data. 
               A location can be searched by its city name or by combining city name, state code (only for US), 
               and country code seperated by commas (e.g. Chicago || Chicago, Illinois || Chicago, Illinois, US).
               Clicking on the forecast report will open up the location's forecast data for every 3 hours over the next 5 days.

            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>Weatherly is a web application that was built using CSS, HTML, and jQuery. 
               It utilizes OpenWeather's weather APIs in order to retrieve current and future forecast data based on location.
               Using jQuery, Weatherly fetches data from the API using Ajax techniques to provide a more seamless user interface that is fast and satisfying 
               as well as to dynamically change the content of HTML elements and CSS styling.
               CSS was used to make the application decorative and responsive so it could be viewed on many phones and tablets 
               while HTML provided the structure for the content to be displayed to the user.
